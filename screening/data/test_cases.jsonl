{"id":"PMID:33480264","title":"Resveratrol supplementation and type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract":"Researchers examined literature on resveratrol supplementation's effects on diabetes parameters in humans. The analysis included 30 experimental studies from multiple databases (PubMed, Lilacs, Scielo, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane). Key findings indicated that almost 60% demonstrated at least one significant effect related to diabetes management. Meta-analysis revealed significant reductions in insulin resistance and glycated hemoglobin levels. For fasting blood glucose, significant effects appeared only in individuals already diagnosed with diabetes. The authors concluded that resveratrol supplementation has protective effects on diabetes parameters."}
{"id":"PMC10995851","title":"Association of metformin use and cancer incidence: a systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract":"The research examined whether metformin use relates to cancer risk. Investigators searched multiple databases through March 2023 and included 166 studies evaluating cancer incidence. Results showed reduced overall cancer risk in case-control studies (RR = 0.55) and prospective cohort studies (RR = 0.65). Metformin was associated with lower risk for gastrointestinal cancers (RR = 0.79), urologic cancers (RR = 0.88), and hematologic malignancies (RR = 0.87). However, significant publication bias and heterogeneity limit confidence in findings. The authors note that additional research in non-diabetic populations is necessary."}
