The study is a randomized, open‑label, controlled trial in India with 62 T2DM patients. Intervention: 250 mg resveratrol capsule daily for 12 weeks plus standard oral hypoglycemics. Control: standard hypoglycemics only. Baseline HbA1c values are reported (9.99 ± 1.50 vs 9.65 ± 1.54) but follow‑up means are not explicitly given, so change statistics and effect sizes cannot be derived. Many demographic details (age, sex %) and inclusion/exclusion criteria are described textually but not numerically, so those fields are null. Risk of bias is judged as some concerns due to open‑label design and incomplete outcome reporting. Additional data such as exact follow‑up means, SDs, and statistical estimates would be needed for a precise effect size. Full PDF tables or supplementary material would help fill these gaps. "
