The study is a 4‑week double‑blind RCT with 19 male type 2 diabetic patients, 10 receiving 5 mg capsules twice daily (10 mg day⁻¹) and 9 placebo. The primary outcome is HOMA‑IR, reported as significantly decreased after 4 weeks, but no numeric values, SDs, or confidence intervals are provided. Consequently, effect size, CI, and risk‑of‑bias assessments cannot be calculated. Full tables or the PDF would provide the missing statistics. Confidence is moderate (0.7) due to clear reporting of design and outcome direction but absence of quantitative data."
