  "comment_detailed": "The article reports a double‑blind, randomized, placebo‑controlled trial of 800 mg/day resveratrol for 8 weeks in 48 type 2 diabetic patients. Baseline and 8‑week values for HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HOMA‑IR were extracted from Table 3. For the intervention arm, means and SDs were reported; for the control arm, SDs for HbA1c were not provided, so null is used. The study design is RCT, exposure is resveratrol vs placebo. Missing fields are the baseline SD for control HbA1c. Evidence snippets are taken from the results section and Table 3. Confidence is high due to clear numeric data.",
