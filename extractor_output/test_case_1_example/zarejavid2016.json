  "comment_detailed": "The study reports a 4‑week double‑blind RCT of 43 type‑2 diabetic patients with chronic periodontitis receiving 480 mg/day resveratrol versus placebo. Baseline and post‑intervention fasting blood glucose (FPG) and HOMA‑IR values are provided, allowing extraction of means, SDs, and sample sizes for each arm. No HbA1c data were reported, and units for HOMA‑IR are not specified, so they are set to null. The design, exposure, comparator, and outcome data are directly extracted from the methods and results sections, including Table 3 for biochemical parameters.",
