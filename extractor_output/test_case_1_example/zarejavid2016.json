The trial is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in Iran with 50 recruited participants (25 per arm). The intervention was 480 mg/day resveratrol capsules for 4 weeks, coadministered with non-surgical periodontal treatment. Outcome data for HOMA-IR at baseline and 4 weeks were reported, but mean age, effect size estimates, and confidence intervals were not provided. Therefore, mean_age and effect fields are null. The risk of bias was judged low based on reported randomization and blinding. Additional data such as exact mean age, SD of change, and statistical significance values would improve the completeness of the extraction.}"
