  "comment_detailed": "The study was a 6‑month, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled RCT of 150 mg/day resveratrol in 41 overweight adults. Primary outcome was insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index) which showed no change. Secondary outcomes included fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c; HbA1c was significantly lower in the resveratrol group (35.8 ± 0.43 vs 37.6 ± 0.44 mmol/mol). Fasting glucose was unchanged (5.2 mmol/L in both groups). Baseline values and standard deviations were not reported in the text, so they are set to null. No HOMA‑IR data were provided. The evidence snippets below support these values.",
