The primary outcome was insulin sensitivity measured by the Matsuda index, and a secondary outcome was HbA1c. Exact baseline means and standard deviations were not reported, so those fields are null. The mean age was not specified, so that field is missing. The risk‑of‑bias domains could not be assessed from the provided text, so they are null. The effect estimates for insulin sensitivity and HbA1c were derived from the reported adjusted means; confidence intervals were not provided, so CI fields are null. The evidence snippets support the extracted values. Full tables or the complete PDF would provide missing baseline data and risk‑of‑bias information."
