The study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with 32 overweight older adults in the USA. Intervention was oral resveratrol capsules at 300 mg/day or 1000 mg/day for 90 days. Primary outcome was fasting plasma glucose, reported as significantly lower versus placebo, but no numeric values or effect sizes were provided. Consequently, many numeric fields (means, SDs, effect estimates, CIs) are unknown. Risk of bias details were not reported. Additional information such as full tables or supplementary data would provide the missing statistics. "
