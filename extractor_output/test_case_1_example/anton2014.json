  "comment_detailed": "The article reports a double‑blind, placebo‑controlled RCT of 32 overweight older adults randomized to placebo, 300 mg/day, or 1000 mg/day resveratrol for 90 days. Glucose (fasting plasma glucose) values are presented at baseline and as change from baseline. Baseline means and SDs are given; post‑treatment means are calculated by adding the change to baseline. SDs for follow‑up are not reported, so set to null. No HOMA‑IR or HbA1c data are provided, so only FPG outcomes are extracted. Study ID is not specified in the text.",
