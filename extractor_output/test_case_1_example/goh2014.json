  "comment_detailed": "The study was a 12‑week, double‑blind, randomized controlled trial of 3 g/day oral resveratrol versus placebo in 10 type 2 diabetes patients (5 per arm). Baseline and follow‑up HbA1c, HOMA‑IR, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values were extracted from Table 1 (baseline) and Table 2 (change). Follow‑up means were calculated by adding the reported mean change to the baseline mean. Standard deviations for baseline values were taken from Table 1; SDs for follow‑up were not reported, so they are set to null. Units were taken from the manuscript: HbA1c in % NGSP, FPG in mmol/L, HOMA‑IR unitless. No other outcome data were available for extraction. Missing fields: study_id was inferred from the ClinicalTrials.gov registration number; baseline SDs for follow‑up were not reported. Evidence snippets: 1) “HbA1c—absolute change –0.8 ± 0.6” 2) “Baseline HbA1c: 8.9 ± 1.2 (placebo), 9.5 ± 1.3 (resveratrol)” 3) “HOMA (IR) 1.6 ± 1.0 (placebo), 2.0 ± 1.0 (resveratrol)”.",
