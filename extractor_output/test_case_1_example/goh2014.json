The study reports a randomized, double-blind design with 10 T2DM patients, 5 per arm, receiving 3 g/day resveratrol for 12 weeks. However, numeric results for HbA1c or other glycemic measures are not provided in the text, so outcome data cannot be extracted. Consequently, effect estimates and risk‑of‑bias judgments are set to null. Additional information such as full tables or supplementary material would be needed to quantify glycemic changes."
