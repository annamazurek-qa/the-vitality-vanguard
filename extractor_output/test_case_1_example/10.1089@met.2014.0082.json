The study reports AUC insulin, AUC glucose, insulinogenic index, and Matsuda index, but none of the required outcomes appear. Therefore the outcomes array is empty. The study design is identified as an RCT from the methods section. The exposure label and comparator are extracted from the intervention description. The study ID is not provided in the text, so it is null. Additional data such as baseline and follow-up means are unavailable for the specified outcomes.",
