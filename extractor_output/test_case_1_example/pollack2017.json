The study ID was not provided, so that field is null. All outcome data were extracted from Table 1 and the text, with n=30 participants completing the crossover. The exposure label and comparator were clear. No other outcome measures were reported in the requested categories. Additional details such as full PDF tables or supplementary data would confirm the numbers and provide confidence in the extracted values.",
