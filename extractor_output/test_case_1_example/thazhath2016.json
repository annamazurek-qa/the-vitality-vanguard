  "comment_detailed": "The article reports a double‑blind, randomized, crossover trial of 14 diet‑controlled type‑2 diabetes patients receiving 500 mg resveratrol twice daily for 5 weeks versus placebo. HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values were extracted from Table 1; baseline and 5‑week means are identical, indicating no change. SDs were not reported, so set to null. No other glycaemic outcomes (e.g., HOMA‑IR) were reported, so they are omitted. The design, exposure, and outcome data are directly cited; missing SDs and other metrics are noted as null. Full PDF or supplementary tables would provide SDs and additional endpoints.",
