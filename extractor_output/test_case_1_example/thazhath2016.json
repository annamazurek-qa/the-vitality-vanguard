The trial was a double-blind, randomized, crossover study with 14 diet-controlled type 2 diabetes patients in Australia. Resveratrol was given as 500 mg capsules twice daily for 5 weeks, with a placebo control. HbA1c and blood glucose were measured, but the article text does not provide numeric change values or confidence intervals; it only states that changes did not differ between groups. Consequently, I set the effect estimate to 0.0 and left CI fields null. All risk-of-bias domains are unknown due to lack of detail. Additional data such as full tables or the PDF would allow extraction of exact means, SDs, and statistical estimates. "
