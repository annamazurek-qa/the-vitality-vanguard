  "comment_detailed": "The 24‑month crossover trial in 125 postmenopausal women examined low‑dose resveratrol (75 mg twice daily) versus placebo. Glycaemic outcomes were reported for 118 participants. Fasting glucose (FPG) remained unchanged (5.0 mmol/L baseline and 5.0 mmol/L follow‑up). HOMA‑IR decreased from 1.8 to 1.7, indicating improved insulin sensitivity. Baseline and follow‑up standard deviations were not provided, so they are marked null. No HbA1c data were available. The study design was a randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled crossover RCT.",
