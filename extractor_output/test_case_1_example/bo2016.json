  "comment_detailed": "The study was a double‑blind, randomized, placebo‑controlled trial of 192 type 2 diabetic patients receiving either 500 mg/day or 40 mg/day resveratrol or placebo for 6 months. Baseline and follow‑up values for HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HOMA‑IR were extracted from Table 1 and Table 2. Standard deviations for follow‑up values were not reported, so they are set to null. The intervention arms are represented as \"intervention\" and the placebo arm as \"control\".",
