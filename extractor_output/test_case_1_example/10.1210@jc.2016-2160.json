  "comment_detailed": "I searched the Methods and Results sections for glycemic outcomes. The study reports no change in HOMA‑IR after 16 weeks of RSV versus placebo, but does not provide mean values or SDs. Baseline and follow‑up data are missing, so I set those fields to null. The trial design is a randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled parallel group RCT, which I recorded. No HbA1c or fasting plasma glucose values were reported, so those outcomes are omitted. Full tables or supplementary data would provide the numeric values needed for a complete extraction.",
