The article reports glucose and triglyceride measurements but does not provide numeric values or changes for these parameters. Therefore, outcomes_raw and effects_by_outcome are empty, and the overall effect is null. Study design, population, intervention details, and comparison are extracted from the methods. Missing fields include mean age, female percentage, diabetes status, primary outcome, risk of bias assessments, and effect estimates, as the article does not report these. Additional data from tables or the full PDF would be needed to fill these gaps."
