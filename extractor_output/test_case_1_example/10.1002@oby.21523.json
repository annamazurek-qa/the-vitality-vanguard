Baseline and week‑24 values are in Table 3, but SDs are not clearly labeled; I inferred them from the table’s second numeric column. No HbA1c data were reported, so only FPG is included. The study ID is not provided, so it is null. Missing fields: study_metadata.study_id, outcomes[0].baseline_sd, outcomes[0].followup_sd. Evidence: \"Glucose (mg/dL) 91.7 68.96\" and \"Glucose (mg/dL) ... 66.25 2.81\".",
