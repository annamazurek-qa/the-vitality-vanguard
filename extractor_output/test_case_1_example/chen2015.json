  "comment_detailed": "I identified the study as a randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled trial of 60 NAFLD patients receiving 600 mg/day resveratrol for 3 months. Baseline and change data for fasting glucose and HOMA‑IR were extracted from Tables 2 and 4. HbA1c was not reported, so that outcome is omitted. Units for HOMA‑IR are not specified, so left null. The study ID is not provided in the text. Full tables or a PDF would give exact follow‑up means and SDs, but the change values are used to approximate them.",
