The study reports a 31.8% decrease in fasting insulin and a 66.3% increase in insulin sensitivity index, but no absolute means, SDs, or confidence intervals are provided. Consequently, outcome tables and effect estimates cannot be extracted. The design is a randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled trial in 34 women with PCOS recruited in Poland, with 1500 mg/day resveratrol for 12 weeks. Because key numeric data are missing, many fields are set to null and listed in missing_fields. Confidence is low due to incomplete data.}"
