The study reports fasting insulin and insulin sensitivity index but not the specified outcomes, so the outcomes array is empty. Study enrollment and completion numbers were noted but not required by the schema, so they are listed as missing fields. The exposure and comparator are clearly stated. Confidence is high that no relevant outcomes were reported.",
