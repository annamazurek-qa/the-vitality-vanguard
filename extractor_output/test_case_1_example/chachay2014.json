  "comment_detailed": "The article reports a double‑blind, placebo‑controlled RCT of 20 overweight men with NAFLD receiving 3000 mg/day resveratrol for 8 weeks. I extracted the study design, exposure, and comparator. Glycaemic outcomes were reported as medians with inter‑quartile ranges in Table 2 (HOMA‑IR and fasting glucose). Because the paper does not provide means or standard deviations, those fields are set to null. No HbA1c data were reported. Additional data such as mean values, SDs, or individual patient data would allow more precise effect estimates.",
