The study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT with 20 male participants in Australia. Dosing was 3000 mg/day for 8 weeks. Primary outcome was insulin sensitivity measured by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, but no numeric results are provided in the text. Therefore, effect size, CI, and risk of bias assessments cannot be derived. Additional data such as tables or full PDF would be needed to extract numeric outcomes and compute effect estimates."
